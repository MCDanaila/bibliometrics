The main task of Bibliometrics is to parse and ingest data, and there is a CLI (Command Line Interface) command for that.

We distinguish between two different data sources: `scopus` and `wos`.

If we want to ingest data from *Scopus* the command is
```console
$ poetry run biblio scopus ingest <path_to_data>
```
If, on the other hand, the data comes from *Web Of Science*
```console
$ poetry run biblio wos ingest <path_to_data>
```

The path may be that of a `zip` file or a directory, and multiple paths may be passed
```console
$ poetry run biblio wos ingest test_data/scopus ../../randomfile.zip
```

If you want the ingestion process to print out a log of the ingested file somewhere,
you have to pass the path of the output file with the optional argument `--output`
```console
$ poetry run biblio wos ingest test_data/wos/test.zip --output outfile
```

If you want the ingestion to ignore certain files that you might be passing to it (perhaps because they are inside a large directory), the names of those files must be written in a file that is passed via the optional argument `--ignore`
```console
$ poetry run biblio wos ingest test_data/wos/test.zip --ignore old_data.txt
```
Ideally to the `--ignore` option should be passed a file generated by the `--output` option in a previous ingestion.

> If the `--ignore` file is passed but the `--output` one is not, the `--output` will be automatically set equal to the `--ignore`.
